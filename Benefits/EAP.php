<h1 class="headerPages">Employee Assistance Program</h1>

<p>We all know that work can be exhausting no matter how exciting it is. This is why self-care is really important and at Convo we do understand that.</p>

<p>In partnership with PayChex, we are eager to share with you that all Convo employees can now qualify for additional free benefits through multiple programs such as <a href="EAP/BalanceWorks.pdf" target="_blank">BalanceWorks</a> and <a href="EAP/WorkingAdvantage.pdf" target="_blank">Working Advantage</a>.</p> 

<p>Through all these programs you will be able to get discounts on multiple products and services that will help you balance work and life, stay healthy and receive additional services you may need at a reasonable cost.</p>

<p>Please check out all the benefits information and take advantage of all the offers.</p>

<p>Again remember, there is no cost to you to enroll in any of the offered programs.</p>

As you have may noticed that we have a new app at one or two stations* at your call center and we have asked to keep the station hot at all times . Some of you are curious why?  We got answers for you from one of our leaders in Information Technology department.<br><br>
Please click the video to watch our Vice President of Technology answering the most common questions along with some updates. Enjoy!<br><br>
If you have further questions, please reach out to your managers, however, I am available, if needed.<br><br>

    <p style="text-align: left;">FCC Regulatory Update</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2inL6B-2oaI?rel=0" width="600" height="337" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><br/><p>Hello, here is the first FCC regulatory update since the last rate freeze. There hasn&rsquo;t been any recent updates due to no actions from the FCC. However, FCC has a few plans in place for the 2017 year. For example, last November they did a FNPRM to discuss some possible measurements for VRS performances such as skills-based routing, deaf interpreters, adding a reduction to speed of call answers, and providing phone numbers to hearing people. FCC plans to make progress with these.</p>
<p>In the past year, the FCC froze rates for small VRS providers (such as us). This freeze period will end this upcoming November 1st. Prior to the freeze, our rate was $5.29 per minute. Starting on November 1st, our rate will drop to $5.06 per minute. On May 1st, the rate will be reduced again to $4.82 per minute.</p>
<p>What are Convo&rsquo;s plan for the regulatory issues? We will continue working closely with the FCC, with customer groups, and with other VRS providers on several areas. 1.) Rate resolution. Jarrod and I will meet with the FCC to determine a rate resolution that will provide company stability for the next few years. We also met with other VRS providers and consumer groups to agree on a rate that will work for all parties. We will then consult with the consumer group on ways to improve the VRS experience. There are a few that possibly will progress faster than others. For example, a skills-based routing system and working with Deaf interpreters may progress faster because of the FNPRM rule-making that already happened last year.</p>
<p>One area we&rsquo;d like to work closely on is improving metrics for understanding VRS quality. There are some things we can measure, such as the speed of answer, but with other things, like interpreter quality, we don&rsquo;t have metrics for that. We would like to find a solution for measuring quality. We would be able to tie together the results with our rate resolution.</p>
<p>One last thing we&rsquo;d like to work on is our VRS interoperability and compatibility with our VP technologies. We are still seeing issues with black screens and lackluster video quality. We have a strong relationship with other VRS providers through the forum medium to work solely on VRS standards. In the past, Sorenson had VP-200 that did not meet our interoperability standards. Now, with their nTouch they are getting there, but it&rsquo;s still a work in progress. We will all work together on improving interoperability.</p>
<p>Convo has a great plan to get us ahead of the times. I look forward to its future with Jarrod&rsquo;s strong leadership at the helm, along with our great executive team and our managers. We will work hard on maintaining a stable growth for the company.</p>
<p>It is good seeing you all, and until next time. Bye-bye.</p>

    <p>Hello everyone,<br /><br />
    I hope this finds each of you well and happy. I am still floating from our amazing weekend in Rochester. We had an excellent turnout. It was such a pleasure to be there and feel the strong sense of community spirit in Rochester.<br /><br />
    As you know we are always looking for ways to improve our call centers and the experience and well being of our interpreters. In the past year we have had numerous improvements: Mobile, Rochester, Pleasanton and Roseville. Finally, Fort Wayne's time has come. Since day one Fort Wayne has been a heavy weight in our success. Numerous interpreters have faithfully commuted, some nearly two hours each way, from the Toledo area to serve in the Fort Wayne center. Now, we are excited to share and celebrate with you our plans to open two new centers in the region. Convo will have a new home in Fort Wayne and in Toledo.<br /><br />
    Here is a video of our announcement of the new call centers to the Ft. Wayne team... Enjoy!<br /><br />

    We turn seven years     old today! There have been some ups and downs, unexpected changes, and extraordinary growth along the way, but one thing has remained the same: our passion in elevating our Deaf community. We couldn't be any prouder of our work, and we're nowhere near done.<br /><br />

    <p>Folks,<br /><br />
    This is the beginning of a very exciting time ahead.<br /><br />
    We witnessed the impact of our Beyoutiful campaign and that has led us to an even bigger vision this year: the Community campaign. In three weeks, we will host the first of several events spotlighting Deaf communities. And our first event is where? Yep, you guessed it: Austin, Texas!<br /><br />
    As we premiere a short film about the Austin Deaf Community, it will also act as a launchpad for a new Convo feature: Community Directory, a central resource tailored to specific Deaf communities. Think of it as an extension of our Deaf Ecosystem Directory.<br /><br />
    Have questions about the new Community Directory? Please feel free to contact your supervisor if you would like to learn more.<br /><br />

    We have some great news to share!<br /><br />
    As you may remember, we've had some back-and-forth over the past few years with FCC regarding rate cuts. After repeated visits to FCC and thanks to all of you, our hard work has finally paid off and we can now breathe: FCC has ordered a rate-cut freeze for Tier-1 companies.<br /><br />
    This means we can continue to be an innovative company for the Deaf community.<br /><br />

If you'd like to make personal VRS calls, you may log in your personal phone number. Please be careful to never mix the two to ensure confidentiality for your personal calls and because we are not allowed to bill to the FCC any minutes from Convo business-related VRS calls.<br /><br />
        Everyone must sign their acknowledgement of the revised policy on Convo Work Phone Number as indicated at the end of the page. You can find this under HR &gt; <a href="hr/acknowledgements.php">Acknowledgements</a> in the Convo portal.<br/><br/>
